"Every token (ERC-20) in this smart contract is a bill of exchange in blank - payable to bearer (bearer is the owner of the Ethereum address witch holds the tokens, or the person he/she represents), but not to order - that means no endorsement possible and the token holder can only transfer the token (bill of exchange in blank) itself. In the case of the Ethereum blockchain fork, the blockchain that has the highest hashrate is considered valid, and all others are not considered a valid registry; bill payment settles bill even if valid blockchain (hashrate) changes after the payment. All Ethereum test networks are not valid registries";
