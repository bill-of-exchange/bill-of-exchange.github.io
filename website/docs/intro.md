# Introduction 

Our project is focused on developing electronic payment instruments that, as a matter of law, constitute [bills of exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiable_instrument#Bill_of_exchange) ([bank cheque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker%27s_draft)), leveraging modern technologies such as distributed ledgers ([DLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger)) and [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract).

Currently, we have early prototype, which is based on smart contract working on the Sepolia Testnet ([Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)).
